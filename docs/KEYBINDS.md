# Keybinds

Kokuban ships with a small fixed set of clipboard and scrollback inputs on Linux and a configurable pane, zoom, prompt-navigation and search table on macOS. The macOS bindings live under `[keybind]` in `kokuban.toml`; see the [example configuration](../kokuban.toml) for the full list of actions and the key syntax.

Linux supports these clipboard and selection actions:

| Action | Linux input |
|--------|-------------|
| Select text | Left-button drag |
| Select text while an application captures the mouse | `Shift` + left-button drag |
| Copy selection | `Ctrl+Shift+C` or `Ctrl+Insert` |
| Paste clipboard | `Ctrl+Shift+V` or `Shift+Insert` |
| Select all retained text | `Ctrl+Shift+A` |
| Scroll history | `Shift+PageUp` / `Shift+PageDown` |
| Oldest/newest retained view | `Shift+Home` / `Shift+End` |

Ordinary `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V` remain application input. Paste honors bracketed-paste mode, normalizes line endings, removes embedded control characters, and rejects oversized text instead of truncating it. Copy and encoded paste are limited to 1 MiB. Clipboard access runs in the background; accepted repeated paste requests retain their order.

Omarchy maps `Super+C` and `Super+V` to the supported Insert shortcuts; see [Omarchy clipboard bindings](OMARCHY.md#use-the-existing-omarchy-bindings) for the integration and validation scope.

The Linux clipboard works through X11 or a Wayland compositor exposing a data-control protocol. Other Wayland desktops need XWayland clipboard access. Copy joins automatically wrapped rows, preserves explicit line breaks and copies complete graphemes. Resize reflows retained text without cropping it. See [text preservation](TERMINAL_TEXT.md) and [Linux application validation](LINUX_APPS.md). OSC 52 remote clipboard commands remain pending.

These pane, zoom and prompt-navigation keybinds currently apply to macOS. Linux provides terminal keyboard/IME and mouse input and scrollback; it does not yet implement this pane shortcut table.

| Action              | Keybind             |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Split vertical      | `Cmd+D`             |
| Split horizontal    | `Cmd+Shift+D`       |
| Close pane          | `Cmd+W`             |
| Focus left pane     | `Cmd+H`             |
| Focus down pane     | `Cmd+J`             |
| Focus up pane       | `Cmd+K`             |
| Focus right pane    | `Cmd+L`             |
| Resize left         | `Cmd+Shift+H`       |
| Resize down         | `Cmd+Shift+J`       |
| Resize up           | `Cmd+Shift+K`       |
| Resize right        | `Cmd+Shift+L`       |
| Zoom in             | `Cmd+=`             |
| Zoom out            | `Cmd+-`             |
| Reset zoom          | `Cmd+0`             |
| Previous prompt     | `Cmd+↑`             |
| Next prompt         | `Cmd+↓`             |

The pane, resize, zoom and prompt-navigation bindings in the macOS table are configurable. Linux clipboard and scrollback shortcuts use their fixed input routes. On macOS, `Cmd+C` copies a selection or sends Ctrl+C when there is none; `Cmd+V` pastes.


The pane, zoom, prompt and search bindings apply to macOS and can be remapped under `[keybind]`; the Linux clipboard and scrollback inputs above are fixed.
